I just completed Module 3: Machine Learning for Classification from ML Zoomcamp 2025 :tada:
Using churn prediction project, this module covered:
:small_orange_diamond: Data Preparation
:small_orange_diamond: How to set up the validation framework (80/20 for full_train & test, and 75% of full_train for train and 25% of full_train for valid)
:small_orange_diamond: Exploratory Data Analysis: different groups will have different outcomes
:small_orange_diamond: Risk ratio is group churn rate / global churn rate, or generalizing group outcome / global outcome
:small_orange_diamond: Mutual information refers to how much we can gather about one variable by looking at another variable. Some variables are more informative than others when it comes to the dependence of the target variable on that variable. Higher numerical value indicates higher dependence of the target variable on that particular variable.
:small_orange_diamond: Correlation determines the importance of features for numerical variables.
:small_orange_diamond: One-hot encoding is used to encode categorical features by turning categorical data into sparse matrix. Scikit-learn library is used to turn this data into a dictionary and subsequently into a sparse matrix.
My key takeaway: Need to go through the lecture videos again to make sure I thoroughly understood the concepts.
Something I struggled with or found interesting: I struggled with understanding how linear vs logistic regression are similar or different.
